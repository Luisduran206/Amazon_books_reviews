The well-known Midrash comes to mind.King Solomon applied his wisdom and prudence to help students find their way through the intricacies of the Torah.He was like the clever man in the parable of the large palace with many doors where a man would enter, become confused and not find the door by which he entered.The clever man took a clew of rope and suspended it by the door of entry so that it could serve as a guide to all who entered or came out."

0736693408,The First King of Shannara (The Sword of Shannara),,A1AX6VPDQQZDPV,M Carlton,4/4,5.0,1105574400,Great (what do you expect?),"This, like all of Brook's Shannara series books, is wonderful. I am glad that Brooks took the opportunity to write this prequel. It gives the reader a look into the past and into the characters and ancestors that started the story that continues through the Shannara series. The characters are very well developed and rich, without the droning on and on with descriptions that some authors fault. You learn little bits and pieces at a time about the characters and story that continually make you go ""Aha! So that's why....."" Moves along at a great pace and keeps you wondering, but with enough hints that you wait for the characters to find out if what you are anticipating is right! There are also plenty of ""I didn't see that coming"" moments. I recommend the entire SHANNARA SERIES for anybody who is looking for a wonderful fantastical world to read about. However, read this book in the order of publication - don't read it first."

0670569798,The Power and the Glory,,A319KYEIAZ3SON,Mary Whipple,1/1,5.0,1206576000,"""One mustn't have human affections--or rather one must love every soul as if it were one's own child.""","(4.5 stars) Graham Greene's most elaborate and personal examination of the good life--and the role of the Catholic church in teaching what the good life is--revolves around an unnamed ""whiskey priest"" in Mexico in the 1930s. Religious persecution is rife as secular rulers, wanting to bring about social change, blame the church for the country's ills. When the novel opens, the church, its priests, and all its symbols have been banned for the past eight years from a state near Veracruz. Priests have been expelled, murdered, or forced to renounce their callings. The whiskey priest, however, has stayed, bringing whatever solace he can to the poor who need him, while at the same time finding solace himself in the bottle.Constantly on the move, the priest suffers agonizing conflicts. His sense of guilt for the past includes a brief romantic interlude which has produced a child, and though he recognizes that he is often weak, selfish, and fearful, he still tries to bring comfort to the faithful. Pursued by a police lieutenant who believes that justice for all can only occur if the church is destroyed, and by a mestizo, who is seeking the substantial reward for turning him in, the desperate priest finally decides to escape to a nearby state in which religion is not banned so that the police will stop killing hostages taken in the villages he has visited.The police pursuit of the priest is paralleled by their pursuit of a ""gringo"" murderer, a man so base that he thinks nothing of murdering children, yet the priest even sees value in this man's life, and when the gringo, the mestizo, the lieutenant, and the priest finally come together, Greene's philosophical and religious analysis reaches its climax. For all their faults, the priest is often heroic, the murdering gringo still has a soul worth saving, the mestizo (a Judas figure) offers the priest a better chance to see God, and the lieutenant eventually sees the priest as a human, not simply as a symbol.Greene's novel is beautifully constructed--intricate, filled with symbols and parallels, yet often sensitive and moving. Though the action moves through an almost unremittingly bleak landscape and the sense of dread is positively palpable throughout, the novel eventually reveals the ""power"" and the ""glory"" of faith. In this sense, the novel is as much a philosophical and religious tract--specifically an examination of the Catholic faith--as it is a human story. While some may find the novel dogmatic and the priest's agonized self-examination sometimes tedious, others will find the novel uplifting and inspiring. n Mary WhippleThe Third ManOur Man in Havana: An Entertainment (Twentieth Century Classics)The Human Factor (Everyman's Library Classics)"

B000GRDY1O,VOICES OF HOPE - Signed,,A2X86K2EZCV0U1,"SouthernFried ""southernfried""",5/6,4.0,1042156800,This is the one I remember.,"After reading the series through Patriarch's Hope, I reflected back on them all, and this book is the one that stuck with me. It's been awhile since I read it, but, since it's the one that I remember most, I felt I should write a review.It is a completely original storyline. The introduction of new characters from Pook and Changman of the trannies, to Seafort's brilliant son, Phillip, really added new dimension to the series. I needed a break from Seafort and his guilt trip, this did it.Seaforts' son, Phillip, chases after his freind into the streets of NY. The only people living on the streets now are ""trannies"". These people are the forgotten throwaway's of a society that has since moved onward and upward into the skyscrapers and away from the city. Only heavily armed patrols ever venture into the streets, and then, only if absolutely necessary. Basically, the streets are left alone and ignored, and barred from the rest of the ""civilized"" world. Once there, your on your own...and don't expect any help, cuz it aint coming.It's into this world that Phillip now finds himself...and it's a fascinating world. There are gangs, and subcultures that have arisen out of survival instincts. How they exist together, and the society they have developed, knowing that no one gives a damn about them, is remarkable. There is ingenuity, violence, power grabs, treaties, bravery, and a surprisingly large amount of humor...probably not enough love, but, it is there also. It's a darwinian survival of the fittest society...and it's damned interesting.Phillips obvious genius, coupled with some handy martial arts instruction he had as a child, helps him survive in this environment. He meets up with Changman, a ""neutral"" trader, who trades with all the gangs equally...so as not to piss of any in particular. Changman is the real interesting character in this story. He has many secrets, and is one of the more multi-dimensional personalities in the HOPE series. Pook, is a child tranny, who Changman tries to look out for the best he can. There is no overt emotion or physical show of love and affection between the two. But, as much as the streets will allow, Changman tries to do his best for the kid.Pook is a great character also. A typical street ""tough"" wannabe. Just a child really, but, he wants to be feared and respected. His feelings and emotions can sometimes be hilarious as he's figuring out how to be tough, especially when this ""uppie"" kid just kicked his butt. He's as street smart a kid as your gonna find in any story tho...and you gotta love him.As for the ""TRANNY LANGUAGE"" everyone seems to be lambasting. I think that was as important to the story as any of the characters. The more I read it, the more I followed it. Along with Phillip and other ""uppies."" We all learned it together. It is an extremely expressive slang. That matches the conditions of the trannies perfectly. They wouldn't be Trannies if they didn't have this language. The book wouldn't have been what it was without it. I had no problem following it, and the more I read, the more descriptive I found the language to be. It's just slang, after all, not French :-). Because of how well this language was used and flushed out, it seemed totally natural and part of this world. I think the TRANNY LANGUAGE is one of Feintuch's best acheivements as an author.There is a hilarious review using the Tranny language below mine, I think its completely understandable, and the more you read it, the less you have to think about it. I think they key, is to not think too much about it, and just lightly read over it, the meaning becomes clear. Almost every time POOK talks, using Tranny speak...I smile.Anyway, its a fascinating book, and the best in the series, imho. Those that didn't like it, seemed to have a common problem with it...the Tranny language. I didn't have that problem and thought it was one of the best aspects of the book.I think this could be a stand alone book. It's been over a year since I read it...but, its so different, and the characters are almost all new, you probably don't need to read the previous Hope books to enjoy it. It's amazing I remember as much of it as I do. I have difficulty remembering the TITLES of the other books in the series, let alone any story line. Yes, I recommend this one.SF"
0385249373,Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality,10.19,,,8/8,5.0,924048000,This book will help even the helpless,"You can't go wrong with this book. First, it's easy to read. Second, it's relatively short. In fact, it impresses me as to how much he was able to say in such a short book. I mean, Neale Donald Walsh needed 3 books (conversations with God) to basically say similar stuff. The chapters are also short. This makes repeating a few chapters painless. In fact, I repeated the whole book now twice.You will probably find yourself underlining many passages that you will re-read often and share with others. One that particularly felt good to me was: &quot;Happiness is our natural state. Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture&quot;As you probably know, Anthony De Mello died in 1987. I am sure that his death is probably atributed to; he just plain felt like doing so, and let that be it, so it was good....."
B000NWB5L8,Of Mice and Men,,A12YHRKLVF9AAC,"""too_cool""",1/1,5.0,952473600,A truely great book,"This was a great book. I enjoyed it from the front cover to the back. Steinbeck's desriptions made you pity the characters you were suppossed to, and hate the characters you were supposed to hate. It's not difficult to read, and the ending was a real shocker. Another thing I like are the hints that Steinbeck drops to foreshadow the futures. There are two events which mirror each other, except for the fact that they are between completely different characters. I won't say what it is, because it will give stuff away. So, all in all, it's a great book, and really deserves to be read."
0774032448,Hamlet,,A1JLKPA3EPLFCP,Ashareh,1/1,5.0,990748800,Good stuff,"This edition of Hamlet, with its accompanying critical essays is a good introduction to literary theory (in fact, my lit interpretation professor used it as exactly that). Wofford's essay on the critical history of Hamlet is clear and concise, with an interesting focus on the performance of the play. The critical essays' perspectives include feminist and Marxist theory."

Something I dislike about the plot is that there are a couple of characters actions that come off as very contrived, mostly I find it hard to believe that the main character would share so little information with his companions about the antagonist, leading them to make unbelievably stupid decisions.On the other hand, I think there is a bit of romance blossoming here and there, and it is refreshingly not cheesy, as there is no love at first sight, and he does not go on to describe women's breasts everytime one appears in a scene, things of that nature. And so far no disturbingly violent things have made me cringe like in A Song of Ice and Fire.My biggest complaint is that this does not seem to be a trilogy. It is a prequel to a trilogy. Am I the only one confused by the title? I feel kind of ripped off for $8, but I guess I should read the description more carefully next time."
B0008A3964,The First Part Of King Henry The Fourth (The Yale Shakespeare),,A2STAUT07F8VRR,Scout1980,5/5,5.0,1091059200,The two sides of Hal,"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"

1887368566,Right to Life: And 2 New Stories,11.53,A2TTPQ1YEKUL0D,"Kim Muller ""Kim""",1/4,4.0,1197676800,Frightening and Thought-Provoking,"I just finished reading this novella, and it's the second of Ketchum's books that I have read. Let me begin by saying that I did NOT want to read this book. As a new mother, I felt that it would just be too graphic and too horrifying, yet after reading about 1/3 of it, I began to realize that Ketchum led me gently and concerned into this novella.Sara Foster is a very realistic picture of a sad woman who somewhat fell into an affair with a married man, and an abortion becomes her decision. When she is kidnapped by the psychotic couple, her external and internal struggles are so well-written without extremely gory or unrealistic details. This keeps the reader from suspension of disbelief, which strengthens the connection to Sara. I know a reviewer commented on the somewhat unbelievable circumstances of her treatment since the woman who holds Sara is a nurse, but if you have read Peaceable Kingdom, this woman isn't exactly a well-qualified nurse for anyone.If Right to Life made me appreciate Jack Ketchum, Brave Girl made me appreciate a child. This story and its sudden twist showed me an old gruesome difference between a young child and an adult, and I am sure nearly every reader of it would say the same."

The family joins together in their efforts to make everything perfect for their special visitor. When the mother is too busy to do it herself, she asks her family, one person at a time, to add some pepper to the pot of stew. When each of them say they can't, she asks yet another to put pepper in the stew. Eventually, when they each find the time, they all add a little pepper, some more than others. Unbeknownst to each other, they have inadvertantly added so much pepper that the stew is rendered inedible.

I was simultaneously excited (that a third novel was in the works) and disappointed (that the novel was not scheduled to print until Summer 2007). In January, I read that it was scheduled for the April 2006 release, much to my happiness, and pre-ordered the novel and received it this past Friday. I decided to refresh my memory and ended up reading the entire series over this past weekend and finished this third portion of the series (Trilogy? I hope hope hope there's more!) a little less than ten minutes ago. I would advise rereading the first two installments...now, on to the actual review:I'll be honest with you, ""Charmed Thirds"" was not exactly what I expected. I was more or less thrilled at the prospect of delving deep into the Marcus-Jessica relationship and the mushy-gushy nonsense that I so desperately long for in my own life. However, the novel is much more realistic in that the relationship isn't perfect and (gasp!) doesn't last the length of the book. It instead explores other relationships (or lack thereof) Jessica becomes involved in, many involving drunken sexual encounters. Someone mentioned earlier that this is a fault, but I can assure that, being a college student myself, I know that my peers are very much engaged in such activities on a week-endly (if not nightly) basis. It is sad but true, much like the uncensored version of Jessica's foul mouth, which whether you want to believe it or not.The difference is the sharp-wit which is enhanced by a more mature (but not overly so) outlook than the previous journals. I laughed out loud so often that I had the urge (but resisted) to copy down several quotes throughout the book. It is overall,lighthearted, but holds a good message that most people need to hear: LIVE!"

Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it. If you do understand it, you will see what a great novel it really is."

B000GRORC4,The Color of Magic,,A1I2O9Y3X3HXLS,Arthur W. Jordin,4/5,5.0,1059091200,A Funny Foursome,"The Colour of Magic (1983) is the first volume in the Discworld series. Somewhere there is a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin, swimming through space. Atop the turtle are four enormous elephants -- Berilia, Tubul, Great T'Phon and Jerakeen-- holding up a huge disk that is the world. A moon and miniature sun orbit around this odd grouping. This initial volume contains four novelettes depicting the zany characters and amazing sights of the Discworld. It features Rincewind the [failed] wizard, Twoflower the Tourist, and the Luggage (also called reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits, but who wants to say that every time). Rincewind is best known for his ability to run very fast and very often; he is terrified of almost everything. Twoflower is the first and only tourist on Discworld (Rincewind is not sure what the word tourist means, but he suspects it means idiot). The Luggage is a box with many small legs, infinite storage space, strange powers, and a vicious temper.In The Colour of Magic, Morpork is burning and the brave citizens of Ankh are demolishing the connecting bridges. Bravd the Hublander and Weasel watch from a cool hilltop a few miles away. They see two mounted men and some kind of low beast coming out of the city; the men are Rincewind, who suffers from an overdose of terror, and Twoflower, who had started the fire. They are accompanied by the Luggage.In The Sending of Eight, Blind Io and the other gods are playing a game with a board full of modeled pieces representing Bravd, Weasel and other heroes and champions. Lady is down to only Rincewind and Twoflower. Blind Io rolls three fives, but Lady rolls a six, a three and a seven.In The Lure of the Wyrm, Rincewind, Twoflower, Hrun the Barbarian, and the Luggage encounter Liessa Wyrmbidder of Wyrmberg. Liessa wants a man to be her consort and she selects Hrun. However, Rincewind discovers the magic sword Kring embedded in a tree branch, pulls it free, and finds himself learning how to be a [reluctant] hero as the sword plans a rescue of the kidnapped Hrun.In Close to the Edge, Rincewind and Twoflower visit the Rimfall, where the ocean falls off the Discworld, and see the Rimbow. They almost fall off the Edge, but are caught in a strong net. Unfortunately, they are then found by the troll who patrols that section of the Circumference for the salvage fleet.This initial volume introduces the Discworld series. It also initiates the use of irreverent footnotes which are often funnier than the main text. The following volumes, however, expand in all sorts of directions. Some also feature Rincewind, but others include the [mostly competent] wizards of Unseen University, the night watch, the witches, the dwarves, Lord Vetinari, Death, and many more.Highly recommended to Pratchett fans and anyone else who enjoys dry humor in an exotic (and totally unbelievable) setting.-Arthur W.

Hawking does a pretty good job of speaking intelligently on the nature of the universe and some some pretty advanced particle physics, but manages do to do so while keeping it at a level you do not need to be a rocket scientist, or any other kind of scientist, to follow along. Certainly many of his thoughts are conjecture and subject to further disproval by advancements in science, technology and research, but I dont know that any discoveries will totally invalidate his conclusions, just potentially put a finer tip on some of his fuzzier theories."
B000H9R1Q0,The Hobbit,,A1H9BP1GNWLP53,Evan,0/0,5.0,1297382400,Possibly the most enjoyable book ever written.,"Let me just start by saying that I love, and have always since the first time I read it, loved this book. No one should go through life without at least giving this book a shot.In this novel J.R.R. Tolkien pens the archetypal adventure for the modern world, complete with memorable characters, a rich world, and a good amount of danger. The story, although sometimes touted as a book for young people, is perfectly acceptable for adults as well. Regardless of age, this is one of the few reads which will truly engross you from the first page to the last.Do yourself a favor: buy your kid a copy. Buy yourself a copy. This is a book every amateur adventurer should read at least once."
0140860282,Wuthering Heights (Penguin Audiobooks),,A39B2ATJE3KOXT,"game theory ""hodgkin-huxley""",0/0,5.0,1228089600,tragically beautiful,"i came across wuthering heights while i was reading the twilight series,specifically ""eclipse"" as it was mentioned in it..i was curious as to what the book was all about so i read it..in my opinion, it is tragically beautiful especially the catherine-heathclif's moments. true, both of them are horrible, horrible human being but when it comes to their relationship, you can't help but to root for them. One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: ""my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's"", ""he is more than myself than i am"" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, ""if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger""Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."
B000NXBJF4,The Bear and the Dragon,,A1T27G3IRT03MG,Marcsan,3/3,1.0,1009497600,What a shame!,"What a shame, what a pitty!As a huge fan of all Tom Clancy wrote (fictional), I longed to get my hands on his latest work (I had to wait quit some time for it in the Netherlands). Well, I have it now, and what a disappointment it is!To be brief: Mr. Clancy is getting old and grumpy and uses his writing to express his rather boring, old fashioned and conservative political ideas. This must even be a bore for any US reader, but for an international reader it's like reading a 1100 page column in a local small town USA newspaper.Oh, by the way, this book actually features a story somewhere between the lines. And yes, all our favourite characters are in it. It's a shame they are used as background figures."

Zielinski ""erinzee""",3/3,4.0,1042243200,I was enchanted!,"After reading the other reviews of The Penwyth Curse, I feel like I may be missing something. I absolutely loved this book! Perhaps because I read it as a fairy tale. A wonderfully romantic fairy tale. With magic, good over evil, and living happily ever after.I can understand one of the criticisms. The characters in the story did seem a bit flat. It felt to me that we weren&#65533;t given much time in the character&#65533;s heads; how they thought about things etc. But the relationships, within the context of the story, still seemed totally believable and endearing to me. Another criticism in the reviews I read was that the two story lines seemed disjointed. I have to disagree. I will admit, the first time the story switched to &#65533;Sometime Else&#65533;, I found it distracting and didn&#65533;t know what was going on. But then as the story progressed, the stories were drawn closer and closer together, and more relevant to each other, to the point of a complete connection at the end.And the story of The Prince and Brecia was WONDERFUL! I would LOVE to see an entire book dedicated just to them!This is a unique and fun story. I&#65533;ve read over 200 romance novels and consider this to be one of my favorites."

One Child's Life in the Foster Care System,,A21NVBFIEQWDSG,Armchair Interviews,1/1,4.0,1145491200,Read!,"Lauretta Ali's book is about one child trying to survive the foster care system.Lenora and her brother Harry Jr. are being raised in a loving home with two parents, when one mistake splits the family apart. The children try to cope with their mother's depression, alcohol abuse and a dysfunctional family.When the mother decides she needs time to get herself together, they are passed on to their father and his new wife. This situation presents a different type of struggle: ultimately the children are placed in the foster care system. Lenora and Harry Jr. are passed through one house to another, facing physical abuse, sexual abuse and separation from each other.The book introduces us to these families and the other children in their care while opening our eyes to the foster care system. This is a sometimes heartbreaking book, but yet it is so riveting you cannot put it down.Armchair says: Survival Of The Fittest is the story of one woman's triumph over the circumstances that life has handed her, making Lenora's story one you cannot forget."
B0006E4RYA,Soldiers of fortune (The Epic of flight),,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,Marvin D. Pipher,4/4,3.0,1188777600,The adventures of those fliers for whom the price was right . . .,"This is one of a series of books, by Time Life, which explores the history of aviation from its earliest stages up to the jet age (circa 1981). This particular volume presents a portion of that history from the standpoint of those who volunteered their services, generally for high pay, to fly for foreign powers, most often in secret and under extremely hazardous conditions. Their story is presented in five chapters. The first covers the early days; the second, the Spanish Civil War; the third, ""The Flying Tigers;"" the fourth, what the book terms ""an airborne knight-errant;"" and the fifth, the broader war in Southeast Asia which led to and culminated with the end of the Vietnam War.I bought this book primarily because of the chapter about the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the Flying Tigers. That chapter intrigued me but, based on the book's title I also I hoped to learn a little more about the Lafayette Escadrille. In both regards, I was, somewhat disappointed. Surprisingly, little was said about the Lafayette Escadrille, and, for some inexplicable reason, the chapter on the Flying Tigers seemed to concentrate on the adventures of Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, who, based on everything I've ever read, was one of the AVG's lesser lights. To make matters worse, much that was said about Boyington didn't quite agree with what I thought I already knew.The rest of the book, however, was very interesting and quite informative. I learned a lot of history, particularly about the Spanish Civil War and the events leading up to the Vietnam War. I also learned what Claire Chenault did after his AVG folded and World War II came to an end. I also encountered some very interesting and unusual flyers about whom I previously knew nothing. The most interesting of these was the subject of Chapter 4, Sweden's Count Carl Gustave von Rosen, a man who always tried to fly for the right cause and who, unlike his fellow mercenaries, charged only a nominal wage and if the need arose would serve at his own expense. It's sad that Rosen met such a cruel end, but one can hope that he is remembered and recognized in Sweden for the hero he was in life.As for the book: I would recommend it to anyone interested in aviation history, especially history told from the perspective of those few aviation adventurers who were willing to put their lives on the line for someone else's cause (as long as the price was right)."

Granted, if you're looking for a light-hearted read with a happy ending, then this is not for you, but if you love to be moved deeply and if you love books that can move you to tears and send chills down your spine with their final sentences, then this is the book for you. I repeat: this book is wonderful beyond belief."
1588465845,Mage the Awakening DELUXE SCREEN,,A31QYFL810FAW,B. Schenck,7/7,4.0,1130112000,Excellent product,"I think that the Storyteller's Screens put out by White Wolf have only done nothing but improve over time. In year's past, the screens were slightly flexible and not nearly as sturdy as they should have been, and not nearly as nice looking as they could have been. This one is definitely nicely done.Firstly, the screen itself is made of the same material as the hardcover books you buy from White Wolf. In and of itself, this is a huge leap forward, as the screen is about as sturdy as you can get, at the same time being easily folded up for transportation. It's also a nicely sized screen, covering plenty of area that you want to obscure. And the cover itself is very similar to the designs and patterns on the Mage book.The screen has plenty of information from the original WoD book (so you don't need to have it open all the time), as well as plenty of material from the Mage book itself. Definitely something that makes it a bit easier on the spines of those hardcover books (which is a shame to damage in the case of the very beautiful looking Mage book). In some respects, it's almost too packed, as there is literally information all over the 4 folding sections of the screen. So, you definitely get what you paid for.Which is really my only complaint; the screen is almost too full of information. So, it can be hard to find stuff as there's a lot up there. The large type face makes things fairly easy to find, but it still has a lot all over the sections facing the Storyteller. Many might find this a hard complaint, as the more information available at a glance the better... But there's always some little bit of less referenced information that can be left off.Still, all in all, it's an excellent piece of work. For the $14 or so price, it's worth it."

B000NLSAKI,The Winter of Our Discontent,,APCSYUM45ZCQR,"Patrick B. Flynn ""Trick""",1/2,4.0,1229817600,Discontent Inspires Minor Disappointment,"I was pleased, but not enraptured. Whereas ""East of Eden"" or ""Of Mice and Men"" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, ""The Winter of Our Discontent"" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting. The few brilliantly poetic sentences interspersed in passable prose kept me reading.Yes, I will deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B+."

(Who would have ever guessed Michael had a little sense of humor underneath his cool exterior?) It really gives you some depth to the characters, but action at the same time. So either way you can't put it down! I can't wait to watch the movie again :)"
