# Analizing Amazon Books Reviews Using Spark Dataframes 📚 📝

---

# Context 🤓

Modern big enterprises are now trying to focus all efforts in order to take advantage of new technologies and all useful tools it brings. Just like Amazon.

What makes Amazon greater than other big enterprises? The short answer is efficiency and fast response to clients demands, but also Amazon occupies all available data to improve their processes and keep customer's attention. So that every sell, qualification or review represents an opportunity to be better.

## 1\. Description of the problem 🕵🏻

Every day, Amazon has millions of sales of items or services in many areas. Products and services, as well as their quality, are very important, so it is important to take into account sales ratings.  
In this case, the document `Books_rating.csv` consists of a compilation of reviews made about the sale of books on Amazon. So as Amazon wants to increase their sales, giving more visibility to the products that have better reviews and opinions among customers would be an interesting strategy to enhance sales. For this dataset, book sales.

##  	2\. Need for Big Data and Cloud 📈

In today's context, companies like Amazon handle massive amounts of data from various sources: purchases, customer reviews, service inquiries, inventories, and more. This vast amount of information is known as Big Data, and utilizing technologies that enable efficient and real-time processing and analysis is essential.

#### **Importance of Big Data** 📊

1. **Volume**: Amazon generates millions of data points daily, and the `Books_rating.csv` file is just a small sample. Managing this data requires systems capable of storing and processing large volumes without performance issues.  
2. **Velocity**: The speed at which this data is generated demands tools that can process the information almost in real-time to enable swift decision-making.  
3. **Veracity**: Maintaining data quality and detecting anomalies is crucial to ensuring analyses are accurate and actionable.  
4. **Value**: Data analysis provides key insights into trends, customer behavior patterns, and areas for improvement in products or services.

#### **The Need for Cloud Computing** 🛜

Processing and analyzing Big Data requires significant computational resources. This is where cloud computing becomes vital, offering key advantages:

* **Scalability**: Cloud systems allow resource scaling based on demand. If the volume of data increases, as it often does with Amazon reviews, cloud systems can adapt to handle the additional load seamlessly.  
* **Accessibility**: Cloud infrastructure ensures that data and tools are available anytime and anywhere.  
* **Integration with Advanced Tools**:  
  * `Google Cloud` enables the use of advanced analytical tools like `Spark`.  
* **Massive and Distributed Storage**: Cloud technologies facilitate storing large volumes of data in distributed systems, improving data availability and security


## 	3\. Data description 📋

## 5\. Software design 👨🏻‍💻

The software design emphasizes efficiency and scalability for processing large datasets with distributed computing. It provides `PySpark` data processing capabilities that let the application handle batch-oriented transformations and aggregations on large volumes of data. The `TextBlob` model is designed for natural language processing or sentiment analysis to give richer insights that can be derived from a dataset.

For this application, the `polarity` function is used, which receives a given text as an argument, from which it will internally perform a polarity calculation, which returns a real number in the interval `[-1, 1]`. This is interpreted simply by analyzing whether the given value is positive, negative or zero. So if it is a negative number it will mean that the sentiment of the text has a negative connotation, if it is a positive number then the text has a degree of positivity and if it is `0` it is considered that the sentiment is neutral.
Similarly, `subjectivity` is defined as a number in the interval `[0, 1]` with degrees of polarity close to `0` being the most objective, while as the degree gets closer to `1`, then it indicates that the text given as an argument to the function is more subjective.

The application has a modular design, which shows increased modularity in separating concerns like data ingestion, sentiment analysis, and result aggregation. This boosts maintainability and allows integration of new features into the application. Finally, the application is platform-independent.

It uses functional programming within `PySpark` to ensure that Big Data operations are performed efficiently, and it adds a shoulder for cloud storage and cloud computation in order to make the application flexible enough for both development and production-level deployment.

**Code:**

*The complete file can be found in this repository under the name `amazon_books_reviews.py`, below is a fragmented explanation of the structure of that code.*

In the code header there is the export of libraries that contain the utilities necessary to execute the job:
```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, avg, udf, round
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType
from textblob import TextBlob
import sys
```
1. `from pyspark.sql import SparkSession`: Allows you to create a Spark session, which is required to initialize and execute Spark applications.
2. `from pyspark.sql.functions import col, avg, udf, round`:    
    * `col`: Used to select and reference columns within a Spark DataFrame.
    * `avg`: Calculates the average of the values in a specific column.
    * `udf`: Allows you to register User Defined Functions for custom operations.
    * `round`: Rounds numeric values to a specific number of decimal places.
3. `from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType`: Defines the `DoubleType` data type for columns in Spark DataFrames and UDF functions.
4. `from textblob import TextBlob`: Used for text sentiment analysis, for calculating polarity and subjectivity.
5. `import sys`: Provides access to command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), which is useful for handling input/output paths.

The application is initialized by calling the `main()` method where all calculations take place. As a first step, the Spark session is initialized with name `"AmazonBooksReviews"`:
```
# Inicializar SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AmazonBooksReviews").getOrCreate()
```
It is then established that for the application `2 input arguments` are needed, one for the `input` address where the file to be worked on is located and the other corresponds to the address where the `output` will be stored:
```
# Argumentos de entrada y salida
input_path = sys.argv[1]  # Ruta de entrada
output_path = sys.argv[2]  # Ruta de salida
```
Later, using the `Spark` library, the data is read from the input `.csv` file:
```
# Leer los datos como DataFrame de Spark
df = spark.read.option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").csv(input_path)
```
For this project, `UDFs` functions were used. `UDFs (User Defined Functions)` are used because they allow the application of custom, non-built-in logic on the `DataFrame's rows`. `Spark`’s native functions work efficiently for basic operations (like `avg` or `round`), but when more complex transformations, such as sentiment analysis using the `TextBlob` library, are required, `UDFs` are necessary.
Another option to perform the calculation of polarity and subjectivity is the use of the `pandas` library, since `TextBlob` is more accustomed to working with data structures from this library, but since it is a data-intensive job, the use of `pandas` dataframes may present problems. Therefore, the following `UDFs` are defined:
```
# Función UDF para análisis de sentimiento usando TextBlob
def get_polarity(text):
    try:
        return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    except Exception:
        return 0.0

def get_subjectivity(text):
    try:
        return TextBlob(text).sentiment.subjectivity
    except Exception:
        return 0.0

def main():
  .
  .
  .
  # Registrar funciones UDF para agregar columnas de polaridad y subjetividad
  polarity_udf = udf(get_polarity, DoubleType())
  subjectivity_udf = udf(get_subjectivity, DoubleType())

  # Aplicar las funciones UDF y crear nuevas columnas
  df = (
      df.withColumn("polarity",  polarity_udf(col("review/text")))
        .withColumn("subjectivity", subjectivity_udf(col("review/text")))
  )
  .
  .
  .
```
The variable `df` is a `Spark` `DataFrame` containing the columns obtained from the input file and the new columns added with the `polarity` and `subjectivity` calculations. From this `DataFrame` the `SQL` aggregate functions in `Spark` will be used to fine-tune the exact search for the desired result.
Thus, the `resultado` variable groups by taking the `ID` and `Title` columns, which correspond to book data. It then determines the columns to be added: it uses the `avg` function to obtain the average per book, `round` to establish the number of decimal places allowed for numerical calculations and finally `orderBy(desc())` to display the records in descending order.
```
# Calcular estadísticas agregadas
resultado = (
  df.groupBy("Id", "Title")
    .agg(
        avg(col("review/score")).alias("avg_review_score"),
        avg(col("polarity")).alias("avg_polarity"),
        avg(col("subjectivity")).alias("avg_subjectivity"),
    )
    .withColumn("avg_review_score", round(col("avg_review_score"), 4))
    .withColumn("avg_polarity", round(col("avg_polarity"), 4))
    .withColumn("avg_subjectivity", round(col("avg_subjectivity"), 4))
    .orderBy(col("avg_review_score").desc())  # Ordenar en orden descendente
    )
)
```
Finally, the obtained dataset will be saved to the output address provided in `.csv`, the same format as the input file:
```
# Guardar el resultado en la ruta de salida
resultado.write.csv(output_path, header=True)
```
The `Spark` instance is stopped to complete the job:
```
spark.stop()  # Detener la sesión de Spark
```

To view the data set obtained for this work, you can look at the `output.csv` file.
The data set obtained will show a `.csv` file that contains in the top records the books that have obtained a higher rating given by users, which in theory means that those books should be given more visibility so that more people can buy them since they have high ratings, however other criteria must be observed to decide the visibility of a book, such as whether on average its opinions are positive or negative, in addition to whether the reviews given by customers are objective or subjective to a certain degree.
In conclusion, the union and subsequent analysis of all this data can be fundamental factors for `Amazon` to determine which books deserve to be seen more in order to increase the number of sales, selling above all products accepted by customers.

## 	6\. Usage 💻

As mentioned above, the work was done using `Google Cloud` due to the size of the file and the number of operations performed to complete the job. To analyze the use of the application, it is recommended to review the file `amazon_books_reviews.py`.

The `textblob` library is not installed naturally in the `PySpark` environment on `Google Cloud Dataproc`. In other words, additional dependencies such as `textblob` are not automatically included in `Dataproc clusters`, so they must be installed. For best performance, it is recommended to create a new Dataproc cluster specifying the needs that are of interest, with the following command executed in the `Cloud Shell` on `Google Cloud`:
```
gcloud dataproc clusters create <name_of_cluster> \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --master-machine-type=e2-standard-2 \
    --master-boot-disk-size=50 \
    --worker-machine-type=e2-standard-2 \
    --worker-boot-disk-size=50 \
    --num-workers=2 \
    --enable-component-gateway \
    --public-ip-address \
    --properties "dataproc:pip.packages=textblob==0.18.0"
```
Attention should be paid to the `properties` argument, more specifically to `textblob==0.18.0`, where the name of the dependency you want to add is described, followed by the version of interest.

After generating the Dataproc cluster to be used, the structure of the `amazon_books_reviews.py` file must be taken into account, since the command to perform the `Spark` job must be formulated based on this. 
Therefore, it must be ensured that the input file `Books_rating.csv` is accessible and has an address in `Google Cloud`, as well as the output address, since in the application, both are input arguments to perform the work.
``` 
input_path = sys.argv[1]  # Input path
output_path = sys.argv[2]  # Output path
```
Upload `amazon_books_reviews.py` to Cloud Shell with the command:
```
gsutil cp gs://<path_to_file>/amazon_books_reviews.py .
```

Finally to run the `Spark` job, to specify the `Bucket` of interest, run in the `Cloud Shell`:
```
BUCKET=gs://<your_bucket>
```
Run the job with:
```
gcloud dataproc jobs submit <name_of_cluster> \
   --cluster amazonspark \
   --region=us-central1 amazon\_books\_reviews.py \
   -- $BUCKET/Books_rating.csv $BUCKET/Output
```
With this command, the input will be taken from the specified `Bucket` and the output will be saved in the specified bucket or address.

This output file summarizes aggregated book review data from the dataset. Each row contains a unique book ID  and its corresponding title, alongside calculated metrics:

1. **avg\_review\_score**: The average review score for the book, reflecting user ratings.  
2. **avg\_polarity**: The average sentiment polarity  
3. **avg\_subjectivity**: The average subjectivity score

For example, the book titled `"Theatres of San Francisco"` has an average review score of `68.8`, a polarity of `0.1296`, and a subjectivity of `0.3632`, indicating slightly positive and moderately objective reviews. For better understanding, you can see the file `output.csv`.

## 	7\. Performance evaluation 👷🏻‍♂️

To test the application's performance, 3 tests of the same execution were carried out with the difference that for each one a different number of worker nodes was established. These are the machines in charge of processing and storing the data distributed in a Dataproc cluster. They execute processing and storage tasks in the cluster.
For the first test, the previous command was followed where the cluster was created, that is, the job was executed with 2 worker nodes, for said job the summary in the console was the following:

For last job, the following should be menctioned: 
Start time of job: `12:58:29.351564`
End time of job: `13:19:37.167436`
Which means a runtime of `20 minutes and 52 seconds` to complete the task using 4 worker nodes.

**Analysis:**
As seen in the results, by increasing the number of worker nodes, the `Spark` job execution time decreases significantly.
| Worker nodes       | Execution Time         |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| 2                  | 37 minutes 25 seconds |
| 3                  | 26 minutes 56 seconds |
| 4                  | 20 minutes 52 seconds |

This behavior highlights how distributed processing in `Spark` benefits from the increase in available computing resources, achieving greater efficiency and reduced execution times as the number of worker nodes in the cluster increases.

# 	9\. Conclusions 🔍

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating `Big Data` and `Cloud` for massive data analysis. `Apache Spark` and `Google Cloud Platform` enable efficient, scalable, and reproducible complex analyses. Future extensions could include predictive analysis, real-time visualization and more valuable insights.
This work can still be improved considerably, for example, a cleanup can be implemented in the text strings that correspond to the titles of the books followed by another series of filters that allow the elimination of different types of characters, blank spaces or capital letters that cause the same book to be separated into different records because the name was written in a different way.
A lot was learned from this project, it was a real-life use case and helped us understand the possibilities that the `Cloud` puts at our disposal.
